## General knowledge

We try to provide easily understandable and concise backend and frontend capable of generating and importing data (i.e. images), as well as training and testing Machine Learning models for smiley recognition.

Additionally, we want to provide a better search experience by creating a syntactic and semantic error correction with the help of machine learning.
